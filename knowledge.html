			<p class="main-text">Peltier tiles have been used to create multiple inventions that could improve life in 3rd world countries. One of not is a Peltier Tile powered flashlight created by Ann Makosinski. She created the flashlight to help those without reliable lightning in other countries, inspired by her friend in the Phillipines who couldnâ€™t study at night anymore due to electricity cutting out.</p>

			<p class="main-text">Ann recalled hearing that humans were like "walking 100-watt light bulbs. This fact and her natural tendency to tinker and experiment quickly led to the idea of a human powered flashlight, which she soon was able to create. The flashlight is powered by Thermoelectric effect, which we have previously discussed (refer to <a href="theory.html">theory</a>). Thanks to her, people all around the world might soon have a reliable light in their homes.</p>
